            <br>
            <br>
            Start by browning your butter on the stove in a saucepan. You want to do this on medium/low heat.
            You'll know its browned when it gets a nice golden/dark color and starts to smell kinda caramel-ly and makes your house smell really delicious.
            <br>
            Once that's done set it aside to chill and kinda solidify a bit. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In another bowl, sift together your bread flour, all purpose flour, salt, and baking soda and set it aside.

            Combine your sugars, vanilla, expresso powder, and brown butter together in a seperate bowl and mix. Add the egg and egg yolk and mix.
            Gradually add your dry ingredients until a dough forms, then add your chocolate chips.
            <br>
            <br>
            This step is optional but I would recommend you chill your dough for at least 30 minutes to set and rest for a bit but you can bake right away if you prefer.
            Bake at 350F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown.
