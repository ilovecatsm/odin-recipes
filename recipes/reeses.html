        <p>This is another recipe that I use regularly lol, heres the things you'll need!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2/3 cups of peanut butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cups of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp of fine salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup of dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Reeses peanut butter cups</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Start by browning your butter on the stove in a saucepan. You want to do this on medium/low heat.
            You'll know its browned when it gets a nice golden/dark color and starts to smell kinda caramel-ly and makes your house smell really delicious.
            <br>
            Once that's done set it aside to chill and kinda solidify a bit. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In a bowl, combine your all purpose flour, salt, and baking soda and set it aside.

            Cream your sugars and brown butter together. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix.
            Add your dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms, then add your chocolate chips and roughly chopped reeses cups.
            <br>
            <br>
            This step is optional but I would recommend you chill your dough for at least 30 minutes to set and rest for a bit but you can bake right away if you prefer.
            Bake at 350F for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.
